 A quick look at Amdahl's Law

 # The law, named after its creator (a one-time IBM engineer who founded a IBM rival company),
   sets a theoretical limit on the speedup that can be achieved in a computation.
   ## The law has the practical benefit of sharpening intuitions about how speedup should be pursued.

 # A sample problem for Amdahl's law: 
   ## Compute the arithmetic mean of 4M floating-point values on single-processor machine M1.
      Call this problem P.

   ## Compute the speedup of porting the solution to quad-processor machine M4.
      ### Assume that M1 and M4 differ only in the number of processors.

 # A step-by-step application of the law:

   1. Compute response time for P on M1: RT1
   2. Compute response time for P on M4: RT4

   3. Computer the ratio: RT1/RT4
      ## If RT1/RT4 == 1, the response times are the same: no difference between M1 and M4 performance.
         E.g., if RT1 == RT4 == 2, the performance is the same.

      ### If RT1/RT4 < 1, there's slowdown rather than speedup.
          E.g., if RT1 is 4 and RT4 is 8, then 4/8 = 1/2: M4 runs P half as fast as does M1.

      ### If RT1/RT4 > 1, there's speedup.
          E.g., if RT1 is 8 and RT4 is 4, then 8/4 = 2: M4 runs P twice as fast as does M1.

   4. Normalize RT1 to 1 time unit: keeps things simple.

   5. Break RT4 into two parts: enchanced (in this case, parallel) and unenhanced (in this case, serial)
      ## The 'unenhanced' part of RT4 is the part still done in serial mode--no benefit of parallelism.
         ### The data set needs to be partitioned, assigned to workers (threads or processes), the
	     results from the workers need to be aggregated, etc.
	     
      ## The 'enhanced' part of RT4 is the part that benefits from the speedup due to parallelism.

      Speedup = RT1/RT4 = 1/(unenhanced + enhanced)

      ## The 'enhanced' depends on two factors: what fraction of time is sped up, and by what amount.
         How much time does M4 speed in 'parallel mode' when solving P, and how much faster is M4 in
	 'parallel mode' than M1 in serial mode?
         
      ## Assume M4 is four times faster than M1 when M4 is in 'parallel mode', and that M4 is
         in 'parallel mode' 80% of the time when solving P.

      ## Speedup = RT1/RT4 = 1/(unenhanced + enhanced) = 1/(0.2 + (0.8/4.0)) = 2.5

      ## Under the given assumptions, M4 solves P 2.5 times faster than does M1.

 # The big picture of Amdahal's Law:
   ## It's tempting to be distracted by how much faster a 'local speedup' is: M4 is four times faster than
      M1 when M4 is in 'parallel mode'.
      
   ## It's critical to focus on the fraction of time spent in enhanced mode: M4 is in 'parallel mode' 80% of
      the time--not 100% of time.
