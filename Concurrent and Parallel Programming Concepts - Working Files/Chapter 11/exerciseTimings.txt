 Programming exercise for parallelism/performance

 # More data gathering and reflecting on the data than coding

 # The current version calls Arrays.sort(...) and Arrays.parallelSort(...) on an array.
   ## Array has roughly 4M array elements.
   ## Speedup on the machines I tried was about 2.5 for the parallelSort.

 # In the interest of gathering more data, change the program so that it tries various sizes.
   For instance:

  	final int initialSize = 1024;
	final int howMany = 16; // don't go over 20 -- overflow occurs
	int[ ] arraySizes = new int[howMany];
	arraySizes[0] = initialSize;
	for (int i = 1; i < howMany; i++) {
	    arraySizes[i] = arraySizes[i - 1] * 2;
	}

   Get the speedup for each of the sizes, and note any trends in speedup.

 # Do the same for numeric types other than int, for instance, long, float, and double.
